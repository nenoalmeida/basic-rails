ActionPack does routing - the mapping of an incoming URL to a controller and action in Rails. It also sets up your controllers
and views, and shepherds a request through its controller action and then through rendering the view. For some of it, 
ActionPack uses Rack. The template rendering itself is done through an external gem like Erubis for .erb templates, or Haml 
for .haml templates. ActionPack also handles action- or view-centered functionality like view caching.
